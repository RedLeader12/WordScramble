# List and Conditionals 


## Instructions 

- Create an input field (in App Component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below 

- Create a new component (=> ValidationComponent) which reveals the text length as apop 

- Inside the Validate Component either output "Text too short" or "text too long depending on the text length (min = 5)

- Create another component (=> Charcomponent) and style it as an inline block (=> display: inline block, padding: 16px, text-align: center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid black)

- Render a list of CharComponenets where each CharComponent receives a different letter of entered text (in the initial input field ) as a prop 

- When you click a Char component, it should be removed from the entered text

Tips : Javascript strings are basically arrays.
